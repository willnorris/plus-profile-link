your tabs and browsing activity. As you browse the web, the extension will
parse each page looking for certain links to Google+ profiles. If such a link
is found, an icon is added to the address bar. At this point, no data as left

If you click the icon in the address bar, a call is made to the Google+ API to
lookup public profile data for that appropriate user. The ID of the person
whose profile is being looked up is passed to the Google+ API, however the URL
that you browsed to that initiated this lookup is NOT passed to the API.

If you enable the option to lookup Google+ profiles using the Social Graph API,
