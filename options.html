      <p>
        This feature is <strong>highly experimental</strong> and not recommended
        for most users.  This will call the SGAPI to lookup every page you visit
        (unless a Google+ profile was already found on the page by other means).
        This may have both performance and privacy implications.  Also be aware
        that <a
          href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/renewing-old-resolutions-for-new-year.html">the
          SGAPI has been deprecated and will be shutdown</a> on April 20, 2012.
        This feature will likely be removed at that point if an
        alternative service cannot be found.
